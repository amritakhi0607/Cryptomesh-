# Cryptomesh

## Project Description

Cryptomesh is a decentralized mesh network coordination platform built on Ethereum. It enables nodes to form a trustless, incentivized mesh network where participants can register as network nodes, stake tokens for network participation, and earn rewards based on their contribution to network stability and data routing.

The smart contract manages node registration, staking mechanisms, and reward distribution, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem where network participants are economically incentivized to maintain reliable connections and route data efficiently.

## Project Vision

To create a truly decentralized internet infrastructure where network nodes are incentivized through blockchain technology, eliminating single points of failure and creating a resilient, community-owned mesh network that can operate independently of traditional internet service providers.

## Key Features

- **Node Registration System**: Secure registration process for mesh network participants
- **Token Staking Mechanism**: Stake-based participation ensuring network quality and commitment
- **Automated Reward Distribution**: Smart contract-based rewards for active and reliable nodes
- **Reputation Tracking**: Built-in reputation system to identify and reward high-performing nodes
- **Decentralized Governance**: Community-driven decision making for network parameters
- **Slash Protection**: Economic penalties for malicious or unreliable network behavior
- **Real-time Network Monitoring**: On-chain tracking of node performance and uptime

## Future Scope

### Phase 1 (Current)
- Basic node registration and staking functionality
- Simple reward distribution mechanism
- Reputation tracking system

### Phase 2 (Planned)
- Advanced routing algorithms implementation
